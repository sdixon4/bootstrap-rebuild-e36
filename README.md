# Glossier Rebuild (E36 â€“ Your Choice with Bootstrap 5)

This project was created for ICS 314 WOD E36: "Your Choice with Bootstrap 5".

## Description

This page is a Bootstrap 5 rebuild of a simplified version of the [Glossier](https://www.glossier.com/) homepage. It was created entirely using Bootstrap 5 layout and utility classes, without reusing the original CSS.

This project includes:

- A blue promo banner with sale messaging
- A centered "Glossier." logo header
- A two-part responsive navbar with product categories on the left and utility links (search, login, bag) on the right
- A full-width hero image from Glossier's CDN
- Two promotional product sections in responsive Bootstrap 5 cards

## Files

- `index.html`: Full Bootstrap 5 implementation of the page structure
- `style.css`: Reserved for minor custom tweaks (not required for layout)
